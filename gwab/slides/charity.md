##  Diabetes Research

 "We want to know how high blood sugar levels in diabetes patients affect the complex sugar production systems required for our health and ability to fight disease. We want to explore the idea that when small changes in this process occur, they can lead to Type 2 diabetes. The results from this work will not only help understand the human diabetic state at the molecular level but also lead the way for early detection of diabetes."
